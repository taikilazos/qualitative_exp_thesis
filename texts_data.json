      "original": "Background: The purpose of the study was to examine whether early repeated infections due to Trichomonas vaginalis among human immunuodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and HIV-negative women are reinfections, new infections, or cases of treatment failure.\nMethods: Women attending an HIV outpatient clinic and a family planning clinic in New Orleans, Louisiana, who had culture results positive for T. vaginalis were treated with 2 g of metronidazole under directly observed therapy.\nAt 1 month, detailed sexual exposure and sexual partner treatment information was collected.\nIsolates from women who had clinical resistance (i.e., who tested positive for a third time after treatment at a higher dose) were tested for metronidazole susceptibility in vitro.\nResults: Of 60 HIV-positive women with trichomoniasis, 11 (18.3%) were T. vaginalis positive 1 month after treatment.\nThe 11 recurrences were classified as 3 probable reinfections (27%), 2 probable infections from a new sexual partner (18%), and 6 probable treatment failures (55%); 2 of the 6 patients who experienced probable treatment failure had isolates with mild resistance to metronidazole.\nOf 301 HIV-negative women, 24 (8.0%) were T. vaginalis positive 1 month after treatment.\nThe 24 recurrences were classified as 2 probable reinfections (8%) and 22 probable treatment failures (92%); of the 22 patients who experienced probable treatment failure, 2 had strains with moderate resistance to metronidazole, and 1 had a strain with mild resistance to metronidazole.\nConclusion: HIV-positive women were more likely to have sexual re-exposure than were HIV-negative women, although the rate of treatment failure was similar in both groups.\nHigh rates of treatment failure among both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women indicate that a 2-g dose of metronidazole may not be adequate for treatment of some women and that rescreening should be considered.",

        "Version_A": "For the study's background, the study's aim was to find whether early repeated infections of Trichomonas vaginalis (a parasite that can cause a sexually transmitted infection or STI) among women with human immunuodeficiency virus (HIV) and without HIV are reinfections, new infections, or cases of treatment failing.\nFor the study's methods, women attending an HIV clinic and family planning clinic in New Orleans, Louisiana, who had tests detecting T. vaginalis, were treated with 2 grams (g) of metronidazole (an antibiotic for infections) under directly observed treatment.\nAt 1 month, we collected detailed sexual activity and sexual partner treatment information.\nSamples from women who had clinical resistance (i.e., who had tests detecting T. vaginalis for a third time after treatment at a higher dose) were tested for metronidazole sensitivity.\nOf 60 women with HIV and trichomoniasis, 11 (18.3%) had T. vaginalis 1 month after treatment.\nThe 11 recurrences were grouped as 3 possible reinfections (27%), 2 possible infections from a new sexual partner (18%), and 6 possible treatment failures (55%). 2 of the 6 patients with possible treatment failure had samples with mild resistance to metronidazole.\nOf 301 women without HIV, 24 (8%) had tests detecting T. vaginalis 1 month after treatment.\nThe 24 recurrences were grouped as 2 possible reinfections (8%) and 22 possible treatment failures (92%). Of the 22 patients with possible treatment failure, 2 had samples with medium resistance to metronidazole. 1 had a sample with mild resistance to metronidazole.\nIn conclusion, women with HIV were more likely to have sexual re-exposure than were women without HIV. However, the rate of treatment failure was similar in both groups.\nHigh rates of treatment failure among both women with and without HIV indicate that a 2-g dose of metronidazole may not the best treatment of some women and that retesting should be considered.",
        "Version_B": "The goal of this research is to figure out what happens when many people get infected again by an STI called trichomoniasis in both those who have AIDS and do not have it.\nWomen from two clinics received treatment at this place because they tested positive for Trichomonas vaginalis using cultures; each woman was given 2000 milligrams of Metronidazol while being watched by healthcare workers during their visit.\nAt age of 30 days, we asked about their sex life in detail including who they had been intimate with recently.\nWomen whose bodies resisted antibiotic treatments, which they took three times as much of than usual, showed that their bacteria could still be killed by another medicine called metronizadole when it was put on them outside of people's bodies.\nOf sixty HIV-infected females who had been treated for an infection called Trichomonas vaginitis, eleven of them tested positive again just over four weeks later.\nThe eleven cases included three possible re-infections, two likely infections acquired through sex partners, six failed treatments where five people showed some antibiotic weakness against Metronidazol.\nOf 301 healthy women who didn't have AIDS virus infection, about eight percent had Trichomonas parasite in their vagina one month later when they finished taking medicine for it.\nThe 24 cases included two possible infections from outside sources that happened again after initial recovery, twenty-two failed treatments where bacteria did not respond well enough to medication; among those whose treatments didn't work properly for them, only three people's bacterial samples showed some level of antibiotic drug weakness - specifically, two moderately resistant ones and another mildly weak against an antibacterial called Metronidazol.\nHIV positive females are at higher risk for future infections compared to those who don't carry this virus; however their chances of not responding well to medication aren't significantly different from non-infected individuals.\nHigh levels of unsuccessful treatments in both infected and uninfected females suggest using more than two grams of this antibiotic might sometimes fail, so re-testing is recommended.",
        "Version_C": "The goal is to figure out what happens when people get infected again by this type of bacteria called trachomona's vaginallis  , which can happen even after they have gotten better because either it came back through there sexual partener as a re-infection from them,or got another infeciton on its own, or maybe the cure didnt work for some reason so now we need to find out why.\nWomen from clinics attended by people living with AIDS and those seeking birth control services received treatment after testing positive for a parasite causing STDs; this included taking two grams of antibiotics while being watched as you swallow them.\nAt 1-month follow-up, detailed sexual exposure and sexual partner treatment information were collected.\nSamples of bacteria taken from women that have been treated three times without success using an even stronger version are grown in the laboratory to find out whether they can survive when exposed to this particular type of antibiotic.\nResults of testing showed that among sixty people living with AIDS who had contracted an STD caused by T.\nThe 11 relapses were classified into three categories; first there was twenty-seven percent that resulted from nineteen percent being infected by someone else for the second time while fifty-five percent showed signs indicating that antibiotics like amoxicillin weren't effective against bacterial growth within them so two out of six people whose treatments didn't work at all tested positive on lab tests using only small amounts of an antibacterial drug called antibiotic which they took regularly but still developed symptoms due to resistant bacteria strains present inside those particular individuals' bodies.\nOf 301 women who do not have AIDS virus infection, 8% had an STD caused by a parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis 30 days later when they received their medication for it.\nThe 24 relapses were classified into two categories - eight percent being repeat infections from their partners and ninety-two percent having treatments that are likely failing; among those whose treatments aren't working there was an individual infected by parasites resistant at low levels to antibiotics such as amoxicillin but also another person suffering due to bacteria which is only slightly less effective against this particular type of medication known commonly used for treating bacterial vaginosis caused mainly when certain types of sexually transmitted diseases occur including chlamydia gonorrhea trichomoniasis etc.\nHIV-positive women are more likely than HIV-negative ones to be exposed again thru sex; however their rates for treatments that aren't working remain equal.\nAntibiotic use has high levels of treatment not being effective amongst those who are positive as well as negative; therefore it is recommended you give them an extra two grams which isn't always sufficient so they might need another round of tests done again.",

      "original": "Background: In a randomized controlled trial of 2 g (single-dose) metronidazole (MTZ) versus 500 mg twice daily for 7 days (multidose) for Trichomonas vaginalis treatment, multidose was superior.\nWe examined if the effect was similar by select clinical factors to determine if treatment recommendations could be targeted.\nMethods: The primary outcome was T. vaginalis repeat infection at test-of-cure (TOC) 4 weeks after completion of therapy.\nAnalyses were stratified by T. vaginalis history, baseline genital symptoms, and concurrent diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) per Nugent score at baseline.\nResults: Women who returned for TOC (n = 540) were included.\nAt baseline, 52.9% had a self-reported history of T. vaginalis; 79.3%, genital symptoms; 5.8%, a gonorrhea diagnosis; and 47.5%, BV.\nDuring follow-up, 97.4% took all MTZ as instructed and 34.5% had interval condomless sex with a baseline partner.\nAt TOC, 14.8% tested positive for T. vaginalis.\nIn stratified analysis, women randomized to single-dose MTZ had a higher rate of TOC T. vaginalis positivity than those randomized to multidose if they were symptomatic at baseline (21.4% vs. 10.8%, P = 0.003) or had a reported history of T. vaginalis (24.1% vs. 12.6%, P = 0.01).\nTest-of-cure T. vaginalis positivity was higher for women receiving a single dose (18.9%) versus multidose (10.8%), irrespective of baseline BV status (P > 0.06).\nIn multivariable analysis, only a history of T. vaginalis and single-dose MTZ were independently associated with a positive TOC for T. vaginalis.\nConclusions: Although multidose MTZ is recommended for all women with T. vaginalis, it is especially important for women with a T. vaginalis history and, given high posttreatment infection rates, a TOC should be performed.",

        "Version_A": "For the study's background, the trials showed that 500 milligrams (mg) of metronidazole (MTZ) - an antibiotic for infections - twice daily for 7 days (multidose) was better than 2 grams or g (single-dose) of MTZ for treating Trichomonas vaginalis (a parasite that can cause a sexually transmitted disease or STD).\nWe checked if the effect was similar by specific clinical factors to check if treatment recommendations could be targeted.\nThe main outcome of the study was T. vaginalis repeat infection during follow-up testing 4 weeks after completion of treatment.\nAnalyses were grouped by if the patient had T. vaginalis in the past, starting symptoms of the genitalia, and same-time diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) - vaginal inflammation caused by a bacterial infection - at the start.\nThe study included 540 women who returned for follow-up testing.\nAt start, 52.9% mentioned having T. vaginalis in the past. 79.3% had genital symptoms. 5.8% were identified with gonorrhea (an STD caused by a specific bacteria). 47.5% had BV.\nDuring follow-up visits, 97.4% took all MTZ as instructed. 34.5% had condomless sex with a partner.\nAt follow-up testing, T. vaginalis was detected in 14.8%.\nIn grouped analysis, women taking single-dose MTZ had a higher rate of T. vaginalis than those given multidose if they showed symptoms at the start or had T. vaginalis before.\nFollow-up testing detecting T. vaginalis was higher in women given single dose (18.9%) than multidose (10.8%), regardless of having BV at the start or not.\nOnly having T. vaginalis in the past and single-dose MTZ were associated with detection of T. vaginalis.\nIn conclusion, while multidose MTZ is recommended for all women with T. vaginalis, it is very important for women with T. vaginalis in the past. Given high after-treatment infection rate, follow-up testing should be done.",
        "Version_B": "In an experiment where people took either all at once a single dose of MTZ that is two grams strong OR over seven days doses totaling five hundred milligrams each time taken in twos, those who got more than one does were cured better.\nWe looked at whether certain characteristics of patients were associated with how well they responded to treatments so that we can give more specific advice on what works best for whom.\nThe main goal measured how often Trichomonas vaginalis came back in women who had finished their treatment four weeks later.\nAnalyses were divided into groups based on whether participants had Trichomonas infection in their past, current genitourinary problems when they started, and BV according to how many bacteria were present initially as measured using the Nugent scoring system.\nThe results showed that women, totaling five hundred forty, came back for treatment of their condition.\nAt first testing, almost half reported having Trichomonas vaginitis infection, about three-quarters experienced genitourinary discomforts, less than six percent were diagnosed as suffering from Gonorrhoea disease, while nearly five out of ten women suffered from Bacterial Vaginosis condition.\nDuring check-ups, almost everyone followed instructions about taking medication completely; however, nearly one-third of them still engaged in unprotected sexual activity during their treatment period with someone they initially met at study start.\nAt testing on arrival at hospital, nearly fifteen percent of patients had Trichomonas infection in their vagina.\nWomen who took only one dose of an antibiotic called metronidazole for trichomoniasis infection showed more signs that it was still present in their vagina compared to women taking several doses when they already felt sick from symptoms before treatment started or previously knew about having this type of bacteria inside them.\nWomen who got only one treatment had more positive test results than those getting many treatments, regardless of their initial bacterial infection condition.\nA past infection from Trichomonas vaginallis and taking just once dose of metronidazole was linked separately in complex statistical tests to having an active case of this parasite.\nMultidose metronidazole treatment is advised particularly for those who have had Trichomonas vaginitis before; after this therapy, another test of cure must also take place due to its relatively low success rate in preventing future infections.",
